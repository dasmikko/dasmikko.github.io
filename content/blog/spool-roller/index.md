Ok, so I wanted to improve the stock spool holder on my Creality CR-6 SE. It's just bit of plastic that you put the spool on, and it adds a lot of friction when printing. It does the job, but it could be better.

I found this spool roller on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4740713), and decided to print it. It's a simple design, but sadly it seem to work as I wanted.
