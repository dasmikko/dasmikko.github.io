I've been 3D printing for a couple of years now, and can relatively easily create various practical things in Plasticity 3D.
While this is awesome, and it's great to be able to create stuff to repair or solve an issue I'm having with something, I've been craving to create more creative stuff.

I have pretty much binge-watched a tonne of Nomad Sculpt videos, and see other people create these amazing things, which sparked a thing in my brain.

I was super lucky that there was an amazing deal on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+, which sealed the deal. I bought it, and bought Nomad Sculpt.

It's all pretty overwhelming right now, as I'm struggling to figure out what to sculpt. I ended up making a small sitting toy bear, and I'm actually pretty happy with my first sculpt.

Can't wait to doodle more, and will try to post updates.
