  <p>Alright, so one of my main hobbies is 3D printing. It&rsquo;s such an amazing tool to have in your arsenal as a creator, tinkerer or creative artist.</p>
<p>You can so quickly whip something together in a CAD software, and sit with it in your hands in a short time later. The fact you can print stuff other people have made, is amazing too.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-using">What are you using?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently sporting a <strong>Creality CR-6 SE</strong>, with a couple of upgrades.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fairly decent printer. It gets the job done, especially after the firmware upgrade. I have had some issues with the stock glass bed, but I have since upgraded to a PEI bed, which is amazing.</p>
<h3 id="upgrades-">Upgrades 🔧</h3>
<p>Here is a list of upgrades i&rsquo;ve done to my printer.</p>
<h4 id="dual-gear-extruder">Dual gear extruder</h4>
<p>This should allow me to more easily use softer filaments like TPU. It&rsquo;s also makes it a more stable extuder.</p>

</figure>

<h4 id="pei-bed-plate">PEI bed plate</h4>
<p>I have ditched the old stock glass bed, which I had a ton of adhesion issues with. Now I use a nice powder coated PEI plate, that is mounted magnetically, and is flexiable. Which also makes the print adhere better, and very easy to remove when cooled off.</p>

<h4 id="capricon-bowden-tube">Capricon bowden tube</h4>
<p>This is just a better PTFE bowden tube from Capricon</p>
<h4 id="primacreator-ruby-nozzle-04mm">PrimaCreator Ruby nozzle 0.4mm</h4>
<p>This nozzle should allow me to print with various abbrasive filaments, without nozzle weardown.</p>

</figure>

<h4 id="custom-firmware-community-firmware">Custom firmware (Community firmware)</h4>
<p>I have flashed the better community firmware, that adds a bunch of new features.</p>
<h3 id="future-upgrades">Future upgrades</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on upgrading the Hotend to the MicroSwiss all metal hotend, which should help with potentional heat creep issues.</p>
<p>Currently my printer is inside my house, but I&rsquo;m planning to move it to my shed, so I can print at night, and not have to worry about the noise.</p>
<p>I will blog about it, so stay tuned!</p>
