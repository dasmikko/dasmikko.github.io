      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, so one of my main hobbies is 3D printing. It&amp;rsquo;s such an amazing tool to have in your arsenal as a creator, tinkerer or creative artist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can so quickly whip something together in a CAD software, and sit with it in your hands in a short time later. The fact you can print stuff other people have made, is amazing too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-you-using&#34;&gt;What are you using?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently sporting a &lt;strong&gt;Creality CR-6 SE&lt;/strong&gt;, with a couple of upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>You can so quickly whip something together in a CAD software, and sit with it in your hands in a short time later. The fact you can print stuff other people have made, is amazing too.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-using">What are you using?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently sporting a <strong>Creality CR-6 SE</strong>, with a couple of upgrades.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fairly decent printer. It gets the job done, especially after the firmware upgrade. I have had some issues with the stock glass bed, but I have since upgraded to a PEI bed, which is amazing.</p>
<h3 id="upgrades-">Upgrades 🔧</h3>
<p>Here is a list of upgrades i&rsquo;ve done to my printer.</p>
<h4 id="dual-gear-extruder">Dual gear extruder</h4>
<p>This should allow me to more easily use softer filaments like TPU. It&rsquo;s also makes it a more stable extuder.</p>
<figure class="aspect-video"><a href="extruder.jpg"><img src="/3dprint/extruder.jpg"></a>
</figure>

<h4 id="pei-bed-plate">PEI bed plate</h4>
<p>I have ditched the old stock glass bed, which I had a ton of adhesion issues with. Now I use a nice powder coated PEI plate, that is mounted magnetically, and is flexiable. Which also makes the print adhere better, and very easy to remove when cooled off.</p>

<h4 id="capricon-bowden-tube">Capricon bowden tube</h4>
<p>This is just a better PTFE bowden tube from Capricon</p>
<h4 id="primacreator-ruby-nozzle-04mm">PrimaCreator Ruby nozzle 0.4mm</h4>
<p>This nozzle should allow me to print with various abbrasive filaments, without nozzle weardown.</p>
<figure class="aspect-video"><a href="nozzle.jpg"><img src="/3dprint/nozzle.jpg"></a>
</figure>

<h4 id="custom-firmware-community-firmware">Custom firmware (Community firmware)</h4>
<p>I have flashed the better community firmware, that adds a bunch of new features.</p>
<h3 id="future-upgrades">Future upgrades</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on upgrading the Hotend to the MicroSwiss all metal hotend, which should help with potentional heat creep issues.</p>
<p>Currently my printer is inside my house, but I&rsquo;m planning to move it to my shed, so I can print at night, and not have to worry about the noise.</p>
<p>I will blog about it, so stay tuned!</p>

      <title>Learning 3D sculpting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been 3D printing for a couple of years now, and can relatively easily create various practical things in Plasticity 3D.&#xA;While this is awesome, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to be able to create stuff to repair or solve an issue I&amp;rsquo;m having with something, I&amp;rsquo;ve been craving to create more creative stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have pretty much binge-watched a tonne of Nomad Sculpt videos, and see other people create these amazing things, which sparked a thing in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While this is awesome, and it&rsquo;s great to be able to create stuff to repair or solve an issue I&rsquo;m having with something, I&rsquo;ve been craving to create more creative stuff.</p>
<p>I have pretty much binge-watched a tonne of Nomad Sculpt videos, and see other people create these amazing things, which sparked a thing in my brain.</p>
<p>I was super lucky that there was an amazing deal on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+, which sealed the deal. I bought it, and bought Nomad Sculpt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all pretty overwhelming right now, as I&rsquo;m struggling to figure out what to sculpt. I ended up making a small sitting toy bear, and I&rsquo;m actually pretty happy with my first sculpt.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to doodle more, and will try to post updates.</p>

      <title>Spool roller upgrade (attempt)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/spool-roller/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I wanted to improve the stock spool holder on my Creality CR-6 SE. It&amp;rsquo;s just bit of plastic that you put the spool on, and it adds a lot of friction when printing. It does the job, but it could be better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found this spool roller on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4740713&#34;&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to print it. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple design, but sadly it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work as I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;aspect-video&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;parts-on-bed.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/parts-on-bed.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>
