      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been 3D printing for a couple of years now, and can relatively easily create various practical things in Plasticity 3D.
While this is awesome, and it&rsquo;s great to be able to create stuff to repair or solve an issue I&rsquo;m having with something, I&rsquo;ve been craving to create more creative stuff.</p>
<p>I have pretty much binge-watched a tonne of Nomad Sculpt videos, and see other people create these amazing things, which sparked a thing in my brain.</p>
<p>I was super lucky that there was an amazing deal on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+, which sealed the deal. I bought it, and bought Nomad Sculpt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all pretty overwhelming right now, as I&rsquo;m struggling to figure out what to sculpt. I ended up making a small sitting toy bear, and I&rsquo;m actually pretty happy with my first sculpt.</p>
<figure class="aspect-video"><a href="/images/Bear.png"><img src="/images/Bear.png"></a>
</figure>

<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to doodle more, and will try to post updates.</p>
